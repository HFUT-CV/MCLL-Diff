# NVM Dataset for Nighttime Vehicle Recognition

## Description

NVM is captured in real nighttime streets with a digital camera or cell phone. It consists of 8,450 images and 63 vehicle models. The images are taken from different viewpoints, including front (F), rear (R), side (S), front-side (FS), and rear-side (RS). We name each image according to the rule of “brand_series_viewpoint_id”, where id refers to the serial number of vehicles of the same brand and series.

**!!!** We currently provide 100 sample images (./Images/), and all the data will be made public after accept.
